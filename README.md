# Currency Converter 
The Currency Converter API is a backend service that allows users to convert amounts between different currencies. 
The API supports real-time conversion rates and enables seamless integration into frontend applications for currency exchange functionality.

Built using Spring Boot, this API retrieves exchange rates and performs conversions based on user inputs, ensuring that users get accurate and up-to-date exchange rate data

# API - Endpoint

# Info 
The currency converter app allows users to enter an amount in rupees and select a target currency (Dollar, Euro, Yen, Riyal) for conversion. 
Once the user inputs the amount and selects a currency, they can click on "Convert" to get the result.

#Frontend Integration
The API can be integrated with a frontend application by calling the Link endpoint and providing the required query parameters.
